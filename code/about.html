          Gelos Enterprises Pty. Ltd. was founded in 2020 by David Black and has
          gone a long way since then. David Black's enthusiasm for providing
          high-quality education services motivated him to quit his day job so
          that Gelos Enterprises Pty. Ltd. could give you with a competitive
          advantage over other niche education providers when he initially
          started out. We currently provide classroom and online training to
          students all around Australia, and we're happy to be able to transform
          our enthusiasm into our own website.
        </p>
        <p>
          We really hope you enjoy your education as much as we do offering it
          to you. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions
          or comments.
